Use this page to edit the properties of an existing attribute.
<p/>
When an attribute is created it is assigned an attribute <em>type</em>.
The type can not be subsequently changed. You will have to delete this
attribute and create a new one of the new type.
<p/>
An attribute can not be deleted if it is in use by any product family.
The sidebar on the left shows the product families that are using the
attribute.  You can follow the links in the sidebar to visit the product
families and (if desired) remove this attribute from the product family.
<p/>
For a <em>string</em> attribute, the attribute values represent possible
values of the attribute.  For example, &ldquo;small&rdquo;,
&ldquo;medium&rdquo;, &ldquo;large&rdquo;, or &ldquo;extra-large&rdquo;.
Enter the values in the order that you would like the user to see them.
By design, the attributes will not be alphabetically sorted for you.
<p/>
For an <em>integer</em> attribute, the attribute values 
represent <em>breakpoints</em>.  For example, if 
the values you enter are 25, 50, 100, and 200, then on the public part
of the website, the user will see a sidebar with choices like
&ldquo;less than 25&rdquo;, &ldquo;25 to 50&rdquo;, &ldquo;50 to 100&rdquo;,
 &ldquo;100 to 200&rdquo;, and  &ldquo;200 or more&rdquo;.
<p/>
For a <em/>monetary</em>
product attribute, you can enter the values in cents or in dollars and
cents (with 2 places to the right of the decimal point). The leading 
&ldquo;&#36;&rdquo; is optional.
