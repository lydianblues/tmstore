    <h3>What's a Card Code?</h3>
    
    <p>
      A card code, sometimes called a card security code, or a Card Verification Value
      (CVV), is a three or four digit number printed on your credit card. American
      Express prints the number on the front of their cards, above and to the right of
      the regular card number. Most other cards have it printed on the back.

  <p>
    Because card codes are printed, not embossed, they do not appear on things like
    restaurant charge slips. By asking for a card code, we're verifying that you
    have the card in hand, and that this isn't a transaction coming from 
    some thief who happens to know your card number.
