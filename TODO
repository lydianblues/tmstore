1. Remove Blogs and Forums from the TMstore menubar.

2. Filtering by price is missing from filter list.

3. Redo ssl_requirement. (Gets rid of class_attribute_inheritable deprecation warning.)

4. will_paginate for products doesn't seem to work anymore.

5. add counter caching.

6. helpers/product_attributes_helper.rb is a MESS

7. models/attribute_search.rb has no purpose.  Use models/product_search.rb instead.

8. Add the concept of "related categories".  Add a "related_categories" table with two
     foreign keys "subject_id" and "related_id", both referencing a row of the categories
     table.

   In the place where category attributes are displayed, also display the list of related
   categories and their immediate children.

9. Add counters to the filters.

10. Dynamic Filters:  Choosing a value for one filter may cause some values of other filters to
be unavailable.  How do we model this?
