#
# This is the ancestor chain for Cucumber::Rails::World, the "World" that is used
# for rspec-rails testing.  ('self' as the step definitions run is Cucumber::Rails::World).
#
# Lines that are indented indicate modules.
#
# N.B. Even though we're using Capybara, nothing from Capybara appears here.
# 
# When the Capybara module is included into Cucumber::Rails::World,
# the Capybara 'page' method as well as all the Capybara DSL methods
# become singleton methods on any given instance of
# Cucumber::Rails::World.  That's why nothing from Capybara shows up
# in the following listing.
#
# This listing was generated by running the following script from a
# step definition:
#
#  self.class.ancestors.each do |a|
#    if a.is_a? Class
#      puts a.name
#    else
#      puts "        " + a.name
#    end
#  end
